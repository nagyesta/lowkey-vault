# Contribution guidelines


First of all, thank you for considering a contribution to Lowkey Vault!

## Purpose

This document exists to let contributors navigate how we like to maintain this project.
A contribution might be any of the following:
- Writing a bug report
- Submitting a feature request
- Giving feedback on the repository contents or the wiki
- Implementing a new feature
- Fixing a bug
- Reviewing a pull request
- Helping other members of the community

Regardless of the option you choose, please be mindful about the fact that this is
an open source project. Your contribution is considered to be voluntary and your
contribution will become part of the Lowkey Vault project. Your code contributions
will be released under our MIT license agreement.

## Issue creation guidelines

In case you wish to submit an issue (regardless of which template you are using),
please consider using the search function first in order to reduce the number of
duplicates and the effort spent on handling them.

We have prepared some issue templates for you, to make issue creation more
streamlined. Please use the template that fits your situation best. This can help
us resolve your issue faster.

## Interacting with the community

Please be respectful and follow the [Code if Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Code contributions

We prefer the camping ground to be left cleaner than we have found. Please make
sure to follow the points below:

1. Make sure your changes belong to an issue
2. Keep your changes relevant for the issue you are addressing
3. Maintain test coverage and make sure tests are passing
4. Avoid adding new Checkstyle violations
5. Use the common indentation and formatting settings we use
6. Do not add unnecessary dependencies
7. Rebase your branch before asking for a pull-request
8. Use our pull request template
9. Please be patient with pull requests (it takes time to review changes properly)

## Pull request reviews

When reviewing PRs, please keep in mind that the code you are looking at is from
a person. Be objective and polite. Ask questions first instead of jumping to
conclusions if something is not clear. It is a good practice to give feedback or
provide suggestions in the form of a question. Code reviews are a dialogue after
all!

## Thank you!
