Feature: Key rotation

    @Key @KeyCreate @KeyRotate @RSA
    Scenario Outline: RSA_ROTATE_01 Single versions of RSA keys can be created with the key client, then rotated and result observed
        Given key API version <api> is used
        And a key client is created with the vault named keys-generic
        And an RSA key named <keyName> is prepared with <keySize> bits size <hsm> HSM
        And the key is set to expire <expires> seconds after creation
        And the key is set to be not usable until <notBefore> seconds after creation
        And the key is set to use <tagMap> as tags
        And the key has <operations> operations granted
        And the key is set to be <enabledStatus>
        And the RSA key is created
        When the key named <keyName> is rotated
        Then the created key is using RSA algorithm with <nBytes> bytes length
        And the key name is <keyName>
        And the key URL contains the vault url and <keyName>
        And the key enabled status is enabled
        And the key has <operations> as operations
        And the key has <tagMap> as tags
        And the key was created <hsm> HSM
        And the EC specific fields are not populated
        And the OCT specific fields are not populated
        And the key recovery settings are default

        Examples:
            | api | hsm     | keyName                   | keySize | nBytes | enabledStatus | operations                                           | expires | notBefore | tagMap            |

    @Key @KeyCreate @KeyRotate @EC
    Scenario Outline: EC_ROTATE_01 Single versions of EC keys can be created with the key client, then rotated and result observed
