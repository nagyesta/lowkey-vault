    @Secret @SecretCreate @DeleteVault @SecretBackup @SecretRestore @CreateVault
    Scenario Outline: SECRET_BACKUP_01 Secrets are created and backed up then vault is deleted and recreated to restore secret
        Given secret API version <api> is used
        And a vault is created with name secrets-backup-<index>
        And a secret client is created with the vault named secrets-backup-<index>
        And <count> secrets with <secretName>- prefix are created valued abc123
        And the secret named <secretName>-<count> is backed up
        And the vault named secrets-backup-<index> is deleted
        And the vault named secrets-backup-<index> is purged
        And a vault is created with name secrets-backup-<index>
        When the secret named <secretName>-<count> is restored
        Then the last secret version of <secretName>-<count> is fetched without providing a version
        And the created secret exists with value: abc123
